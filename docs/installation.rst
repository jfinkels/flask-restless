Downloading and installing Flask-Restless
=========================================

Flask-Restless can be downloaded from the `Python Package Index`_. The
development version can be downloaded from `GitHub`_. However, it is better to
install with ``pip`` (in a virtual environment provided by ``virtualenv``)::

    pip install Flask-Restless

Flask-Restless supports all Python versions that Flask supports, which
currently include versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.

Flask-Restless has the following dependencies (which will be automatically
installed if you use ``pip``):

* `Flask`_ version 0.10 or greater
* `SQLAlchemy`_ version 0.8 or greater
* `python-dateutil`_ version strictly greater than 2.2

`Flask-SQLAlchemy`_ is supported but not required.
