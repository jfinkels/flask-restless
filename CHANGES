Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Flask-Restless release.
Numbers following a pound sign (#) refer to `GitHub issues
<https://github.com/jfinkels/flask-restless/issues>`_.

.. note::

   As of version 0.6, Flask-Restless supports both pure SQLAlchemy and
   Flask-SQLAlchemy models. Before that, it supported only Elixir models.

Version 0.10.0-dev
------------------

Not yet released.

- #2: adds basic :http:method:`get` access to one level of relationship depth
  for models.
- #113: interpret empty strings for date fields as ``None`` objects.
- #128: allow disjunctions when filtering search queries.
- #130: documentation and examples now more clearly show search examples.
- #135: added support for hybrid properties.
- #139: remove custom code for authentication in favor of user-defined pre- and
  postprocessors (this supercedes the fix from #154).
- #141: relax requirement for version of `python-dateutil
  <http://labix.org/python-dateutil>`_ to be not equal to 2.0 if using Python
  version 2.6 or 2.7.
- #146: preprocessors now really execute before other code.
- #148: adds support for SQLAlchemy `association proxies <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/associationproxy.html>`_.
- #154 (*this fix is irrelevant due to #139*): authentication function now may
  raise an exception instead of just returning a Boolean.
- #157: :http:method:`post` requests now receive a response containing all
  fields of the created instance.
- #162: allow pre- and postprocessors to indicate that no change has occurred.
- #164, #172, and #173: :http:method:`patch` requests update fields on related
  instances.
- #165: fixed bug in automatic exposing of URLs for related instances.
- #170: respond with correct HTTP status codes when a query for a single
  instance results in none or multiple instances.
- #174: allow dynamically loaded relationships for automatically exposed URLs
  of related instances.
- #176: get model attribute instead of column name when getting name of primary
  key.

-------------

Released on February 4, 2013.

  examples to be many-to-one instead of the incorrect one-to-many. Versions of
  SQLAlchemy after 0.8.0b2 raise an exception when the latter is used.
- #105: added ability to set a list of related model instances on a model.
- #107: server responds with an error code when a :http:method:`patch` or
  :http:method:`post` request specifies a field which does not exist on the
  model.
- #108: dynamically loaded relationships should now be rendered correctly by
  the :func:`views._to_dict` function regardless of whether they are a list or
  a single object.
- #109: use `sphinxcontrib-issuetracker`_ to render links to GitHub issues in
  documentation.
- #110: enable ``results_per_page`` query parameter for clients, and added
  ``max_results_per_page`` keyword argument to :meth:`APIManager.create_api`.
- #114: fix bug where string representations of integers were converted to
  integers.
- #117: allow adding related instances on :http:method:`patch` requests for
  one-to-one relationships.
- #123: :http:method:`patch` requests to instances which do not exist result in
  a :http:statuscode:`404` response.
