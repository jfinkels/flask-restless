Changelog
=========

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Flask-Restless release.
Version 1.0.0 saw a major overhaul of Flask-Restless to make it compliant with
JSON API, so changes from prior versions may not be relevant to more recent
versions.

  all created APIs.
- :issue:`449`: roll back the session on any SQLAlchemy error, not just a few.
- :issue:`432,462`: alias relation names when sorting by multiple attributes on a
