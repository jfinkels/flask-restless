  version 2.6 or 2.7.

  :http:method:`patch` or :http:method:`post` request specifies a field which
  does not exist on the model.
- Fixed issue #108: dynamically loaded relationships should now be rendered
  correctly by the :func:`views._to_dict` function regardless of whether they
  are a list or a single object.
